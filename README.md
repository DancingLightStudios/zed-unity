This package brings the many mixed reality features of the <a href="https://www.stereolabs.com/store/">ZED cameras</a> depth sensors into Unity. It comes with prefabs to make adding advanced features to your project as simple as drag-and-drop, helper scripts to simplify custom integration, and numerous examples to see your camera in action and learn how it works.

## Get Started

To develop applications in Unity with your ZED, you'll need the following things:

- Download and install the [ZED SDK](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/).
- Download the [ZED Plugin for Unity](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-unity/releases).
- Import the *ZEDCamera.package* into Unity.
- Read the [Basic Concepts](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/unity/basic-concepts/) and [Build Your First AR/MR App](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/unity/creating-mixed-reality-app/) guides to get started.
- Explore the [Samples](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/unity/samples/) included in the plugin.
- The [Main Scripts](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/unity/main-scripts/) page of the documentation introduces the important scripts of the plugin and their parameters.

## Example Scenes

After importing the plugin, pick and try some of the example scenes. Each is designed to demonstrate a main feature of the ZED. Some contain prefabs and example scripts that can be repurposed for your projects.

The overview is available in the [documentation for the ZED Unity plugin](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/unity/samples/).
